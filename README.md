## Configuration

Atom VLC uses VLC's Lua HTTP interface to control VLC. So
you need to configure VLC in order to accept connections
from Atom and Atom VLC too.

### VLC

VLC's Lua HTTP interface only works when it's set a
password to access the interface. So go to Tools ➔
Preferences. Bellow `Show settings` area toggle `All` then
go to `Interface` ➔ `Main interfaces` ➔ `Lua`, bellow **Lua HTTP** set
a password.

After that go to View ➔ Add interface ➔ Web.
